# VoiceMaster Pro - Login System Implementation

## 🎉 Implementation Complete!

I've successfully implemented a complete login system for VoiceMaster Pro that allows users to easily set up their Eleven Labs credentials through a user-friendly GUI interface.

## ✨ What's New

### 1. **Automated Login GUI** (`login_gui.py`)
- **Beautiful Interface**: Modern dark theme matching VoiceMaster's design
- **User-Friendly**: Simple form with clear instructions
- **API Key Management**: Secure entry with show/hide toggle
- **Connection Testing**: Built-in API validation before saving
- **Smart Detection**: Shows voice count and connection status
- **Help Integration**: Direct link to Eleven Labs API key page

### 2. **Enhanced Launch System** (`launch_voicemaster.bat`)
- **Intelligent Startup**: Automatically detects if credentials are needed
- **First-Time Setup**: Launches login GUI if no `.env` file exists
- **Existing Users**: Directly opens VoiceMaster if credentials are found
- **Error Handling**: Better error messages and status reporting
- **Path Flexibility**: Works from any directory location

### 3. **Credentials Management in Main App**
- **Settings Menu**: Added "Settings → Eleven Labs Credentials" menu
- **Easy Updates**: Change API key anytime without restarting
- **Non-Disruptive**: Update credentials while keeping VoiceMaster open
- **About Dialog**: Added help information

### 4. **Enhanced User Experience**
- **Guided Setup**: Step-by-step credential configuration
- **Visual Feedback**: Real-time connection testing and validation
- **Error Recovery**: Clear error messages with suggested solutions
- **Security**: Credentials stored locally and never transmitted
